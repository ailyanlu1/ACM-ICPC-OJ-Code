ACM-ICPC OJ Solution Code
========
## Introduction

My solution codes for popular Online Judge Systems, such as POJ, HDOJ, SGU and ACM-ICPC Live Archive. However, I am forgeting the algorithms which I used to solve these problems!

I am going to organize the codes and solutions by contests. Some indexes page will be available so you can locate the problem quicker.

Most of the reports were written in Chinese because most of them were written when I was a college students. However, you may find some useful comments in English in the codes.

Please try to think and solve the problems before you refer my solutions. Good luck and enjoy these interesting problems!
